# Data_analysis_and_visualizationon_on_nipah_virus
The Nipah virus has been extensively studied using an Excel spreadsheet, with a focus on RNA data from various mammals. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the virus's incidence across different countries, identifying hotspot regions and enabling predictive analysis using the linear regression algorithm. The study also reveals the distribution and behavior of bat species, which serve as reservoir hosts for the virus. The RNA data from these mammals is analyzed to understand the impact of specific amino acid codons on mammalian species. The data visualization technique helps identify potential areas of heightened risk and guide targeted interventions. The project also includes a comprehensive analysis of RNA data from various mammalian species, providing insights into genetic variations and susceptibilities among these species. This comprehensive approach contributes significantly to understanding and managing Nipah virus outbreaks globally, guiding public health policies and supporting research efforts.
